Description: Install specific version of Java runtime environment
  at the R project level. The goal of rJavaEnv is to manage multiple
  Java JDKs in R projects by automatingthe process of downloading,
  installing, and configuring Java environments on a per-project basis.
  This package is inspired by the renv <https://rstudio.github.io/renv/>
  package for managing R environments in R projects. You can request a
  specific Java Development Kit (JDK) in your project,
  and rJavaEnv will download and install the requested Java environment
  in a project-specific directory and set the PATH and JAVA_HOME
  for when you are using this project. Therefore, you can have different
  Java versions for different projects without contaminating your system
  with different Java versions.
