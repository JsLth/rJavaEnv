      "description": "Install specific version of Java runtime environment at the R project level. The goal of rJavaEnv is to manage multiple Java JDKs in R projects by automating the process of downloading, installing, and configuring Java environments on a per-project basis. This package is inspired by the renv <https://rstudio.github.io/renv/> package for managing R environments in R projects. You can request a specific Java Development Kit (JDK) in your project, and rJavaEnv will download and install the requested Java environment in a project-specific directory and set the PATH and JAVA_HOME for when you are using this project. Therefore, you can have different Java versions for different projects without contaminating your system with different Java versions.",
