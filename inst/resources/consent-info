rJavaEnv: Manage Java Environments for R Projects

Welcome to rJavaEnv! It looks like this is your first time using rJavaEnv.
This message will guide you through some of the key features and how rJavaEnv works.

rJavaEnv will manage Java Development Kits (JDKs) specifically for your R projects,
ensuring that each project uses the appropriate Java version
without affecting other projects or your system-wide Java installation.

Here's what rJavaEnv will do:

  - Create a 'rjavaenv' folder in your project/current working directory.
  - Generate necessary configuration files in the project/current working directory.

rJavaEnv will also update some existing files in your project/current working directory, such as:
  
  - .Rprofile

Additionally, rJavaEnv maintains a cache of Java distributions and installations at:

  - ${rJavaEnv_CACHE}

You can customize this path by setting the $RJAVAENV_CACHE with `Sys.setenv(RJAVAENV_CACHE = "path/to/cache")`.
Alternatively, you can set the cache folder as argument `dest_dir` in `java_download()`.
The same cache folder is used for both zipped java distributions and extracted distrubution files.

For more information, read the introductory vignette with `vignette("rJavaEnv")` and browse the package documentation online at https://www.ekotov.pro/rJavaEnv/.
