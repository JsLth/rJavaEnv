The goal of `rJavaEnv` is to manage multiple Java JDKs in R projects by automating the process of downloading, installing, and configuring Java environments on a per-project basis. This package is inspired by the [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/){target="_blank"} package for managing R environments in R projects.

You can request a specific Java Development Kit (JDK) in your project, and `rJavaEnv` will download and install the requested Java environment in a project-specific directory and set the PATH and JAVA_HOME for when you are using this project. Therefore, you can have different Java versions for different projects without contaminating your system with different Java versions.

**WARNING** This package is in the early stages of development and is not yet ready for production use.


```{r results="asis", echo = FALSE}
glue::glue('<script type="application/ld+json">
      {glue::glue_collapse(readLines("inst/schemaorg.json"), sep = "\n")}
    </script>')
```


## Install

You can install the development version of `rJavaEnv` from GitHub:

```r
devtools::install_github("e-kotov/rJavaEnv")
```

## Simple Example

```r
rJavaEnv::java_quick_install(version = 21)
```

This will:

  - download Java 21 distribution compatible with the current operating system and processor architecture;
  
  - create **rjavaenv/`platform`/`processor_architecture`/`java_version`** in current directory/project and unpack the downloaded Java distribution there;
  
  - set the current session's JAVA_HOME and PATH environment variables to point to the installed Java distribution;
  
  - add code to .Rprofile file in the current directory/project to set JAVA_HOME and PATH environment variables when the project is opened in RStudio.

After that, you can even remove `rJavaEnv` completely, as the Java environment will be set up in the project directory with the base R code that does not rely on `rJavaEnv`.


## Functions Overview

The package has several core functions:

1. `java_quick_install()`
   * Downloads, installs, and sets Java environment in the current working/project directory, all in one line of code.

2. `java_download()`
   * Downloads a specified version and distribution of Java.

3. `java_install()`
   * Installs a Java distribution file into current (or user-specified) project directory.

4. `java_env_set()`
   * Sets the JAVA_HOME and PATH environment variables to a given path in current R session and/or in the .Rprofile file in the project directory.

5. `java_env_set()`
   * Remove the JAVA_HOME and PATH environment variables from the .Rpofile file in the project directory (but not in the current R session, please restart the session so that R picks up the system Java).

6. `java_check_version_cmd()`
   * Checks the installed Java version using terminal commands. Useful for checking Java version that would be picked up by packages like [`opentripplanner`](https://github.com/ropensci/opentripplanner){target="_blank"}, that controls Java via command line.

7. `java_version_check_rjava()`
   * Checks the Java version using `rJava` in a separate R session. Useful for checking Java version that would be picked up by packages like [`r5r`](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r){target="_blank"}, that initialize Java using `rJava`.

8. `java_list_distrib_cache()`
   * Lists the contents of the Java distributions cache folder in user data directory.

9. `java_clear_distrib_cache()`
   * Clears the Java distributions cache folder in user data directory.


For detailed usage, see the [Quick Start Vignette](vignettes/quick_start.Rmd).

## Limitations

Currently, `rJavaEnv` only supports major Java versions such as 8, 11, 16, 17, 21, 22, etc. The download and install functions ignore the minor version of the Java distribution and just downloads the latest stable subversion of the specified major version. This is done to simplify the process and avoid the need to update the package every time a new minor version of Java is released. For most users this should be sufficient, but this is substandard for full reproducibility.

The main limitation is that if you want to switch to another Java environment, you will most likely have to restart the current R session and set the JAVA_HOME and PATH environment variables to the desired Java environment using `rJavaEnv::java_env_set()`. This cannot be done dynamically within the same R session due to the way Java is initialized in R, particularly with the `rJava`-dependent packages such as [`r5r`](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r){target="_blank"}. With packages like [`opentripplanner`](https://github.com/ropensci/opentripplanner){target="_blank"}, that performs Java calls using command line, you can swtich Java environments dynamically within the same R session as much as you want.

Therefore, if you need to use R packages that depend on different Java versions within the same project, you will have to create separate R scripts for each Java environment and run them in separate R sessions. One effective way of doing this is to use the [`callr`](https://github.com/r-lib/callr){target="_blank"} package to run R scripts in separate R sessions. Another option is to use the [`targets`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets){target="_blank"} package to manage the whole project workflow, which, as a side effect, will lead to all R scripts being run in separate R sessions. To use `rJavaEnv` with `targets`, you will need to download and install several Java environments using `rJavaEnv::java_download()` and `rJavaEnv::java_install()` and set the relevant path with `rJavaEnv::java_env_set()` at the beginning of each function that requires a certain Java version.

## Future work

The future work includes:

  - Add support for more Java distributions and versions
  
  - Take care of [`R CMD javareconf`](https://solutions.posit.co/envs-pkgs/using-rjava/#reconfigure-r){target="_blank"}
  
  - Possibly add support for specifying Java version beyond the major version
  
  - Possibly allow downloading several Java distributions at once, e.g. different major versions of the same 'flavour' or different 'flavours' of the same major version
